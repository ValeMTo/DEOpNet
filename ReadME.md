# Distributed Energy Systems

This repository is dedicated to the development of a distributed macro energy system using DCOP (Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems) and Frodo2.

## Repository Structure

- **Folder Repository**: Contains manually implemented files.
- **Parser Repository**: Contains the parser being developed to automate the environment framing.

To run the `frodo2.18.1.jar` file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `frodo2.18.1.jar` file.
3. Execute the following command:
